## Rhysh Maps
Turns out keeping the Ogmo map project inside of the Rhysh project wasn't as seamless as I thought it would be. Mostly because the number of levels in a map in Ogmo is project dependent, which makes sense for most projects I suppose. I however am managing multiple Z levels within the same map and because not every zone or feature will have the same number of Z levels, I need to manage multiple Ogmo projects, one for each feature "height"
